            <h2>What is Organic Food?</h2>

            <p>
                Organic food has become a trending topic recently. Whenever we visit any supermarket and browser shopping websites to buy our daily groceries, we come across a section where only organic products are sold. Even on various blogging sites, we come across articles related to online grocery shopping and its benefits.  But what are these organic products?<br><br>
                
                Organic food is a debatable topic because different countries provide a different definition of organic food. For a general statement, we can safely say that organic food is referred to the type of products which are grown in a specific way (Mostly in a natural way without using chemical substances).<br><br>
                
                Organic Food or grocery is grown in a natural way without using any chemical fertilizers, growth hormones, pesticides, etc. These foods are expensive because they are completely natural and do not have any tinge of chemicals in them.<br><br> 
                
                On the other hand, organic livestock also exists. In an organic livestock farm, eggs, meat, and dairy products are produced by the animals who are given organic food to eat and are not injected with any chemical substances.<br><br>

                </p>
                
                <h2>Difference between organic and non- organic food</h2>
                <p>
                The term organic food is very new and most of us are not that well-versed with the difference of normal food and organic food. We are only concerned about eating healthy food and research on topics like Online Grocery Shopping and its benefits. But in order to eat healthily, we need to know the difference between organic and non-organic food.</p>
                
                <h2>Organic Food</h2>
                <p>
                <i>&#8226;</i> Organic groceries are grown with the help of natural means. They are given natural fertilizers like manure and compost.<br><br>
                <i>&#8226;</i> The weed production of organic food is controlled by natural products like tiling, crop rotation, mulching, etc.<br><br>
                <i>&#8226;</i> The insects and pests are controlled naturally with the help of traps, birds and counter insects.<br><br>
                <i>&#8226;</i> The organic livestock has access to the outdoors. Hence it can grow in a more natural way and it can have more immunity than other livestock who are grown indoors. <br><br>
                <i>&#8226;</i> The organic livestock is fed natural food.<br><br>
                </p>

            <img src="image/feature-img-1(c).png"><br><br><br><br><br>
                

                <h2>Non-Organic Food</h2>
                <p>
                    <i>&#8226;</i> Non-organic foods are grown with the help of fertilizers and synthetic chemicals<br><br>
                    <i>&#8226;</i> Weeds and other unwanted crops are controlled with the help of chemicals and synthetic herbicides.<br><br> 
                    <i>&#8226;</i> Pesticides and insecticides are used to kill all the pests and bugs.<br><br>
                    <i>&#8226;</i> Conventionally raised livestock do not have access to the outdoors. They are grown indoors and hence they have a weak immune system. <br><br>
                    <i>&#8226;</i> Conventional livestock is injected with growth hormones for faster growth. They are also given antibiotics and chemical infused food.<br><br>
                    </p>
